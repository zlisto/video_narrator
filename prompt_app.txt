App maker app maker, make me an app.
Make me a react app called "AI Video Narrator".  I have a .env file in 
root with keys REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY and REACT_APP_MODEL.
On the app I want to upload a video.  The app will sample 20 frames
from the video uniformly across its duration.  I have a txt box "Instructions".
There is a file public/prompt_narration.txt that takes the Instructions and puts
it in formatted like {instuctions}.  This is my prompt.  There is a button create narration text when pressed
sends the imags and prompt to openai, with the model in my .env, and returns a text.
Display this text in a text box below video.  I can edit this text.  There is a button
create narration audio when pressed sends the narration text to openai TTS model and
creates audio file from voice nova.  There is an audio play bare belwo narration box so i can hear
the audio. Then on a new tab there are two volume level bars for audio of narration file and of video.
0 to 100.  Adter i slide to the desired levels prss "create video" that merges the ai narratio audio
with video and i can play it to hear if its ok. if not, i can slide audio levelsand generate
again.  if im happy, i can downoad the video.  Make this all in one app, no separte backend.
